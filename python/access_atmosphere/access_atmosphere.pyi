    Most of the inputs are numpy arrays and are either 1d or 2d. The
    `pressure` parameter is the pressure levels in hPa and has shape
    (`num_levels`, ). It is treated as a constant (i.e., not a function of
    `num_points`).

    `pressure`: pressure levels, in hPa

    The following are input profiles and have shape (`num_points`,
    `num_levels`):

    `temperature`: physical temperature in K

    `height`: geometric height above the geoid in m

    `specific_humidity`: specific humidity in kg/kg

    `liquid_content`: liquid water content (from clouds) in kg/kg

    The following are surface parameters and have shape (`num_points`, ):

    `surface_temperature`: 2 meter air temperature in K

    `surface_height`: geopotential height at the surface in m

    `surface_dewpoint`: 2 meter dewpoint in K

    `surface_pressure`: surface pressure in hPa

    The following are RTM parameters and have shape (`num_freq`, ):

    `incidence_angle`: Earth incidence angle in degrees

    `frequency`: microwave frequency in GHz

    The returned atmospheric parameters are each dimensioned as (`num_points`,
    `num_freq`).

    The number of worker threads is controlled by `num_threads`. It must be a
    positive integer, or `None` to automatically choose the number of threads.
